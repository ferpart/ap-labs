As the file is made in c, to compile you just need to type the command: 
	"gcc codeChal1.c"
and then just ./a.out


As this is my first time properly using c as a language, the program does
not currently work because of an error that states:

*** stack smashing detected ***: <unknown> terminated
Aborted (core dumped)


I would like to be given help in how to fix this issue as i don't quite know
what is causing this.
