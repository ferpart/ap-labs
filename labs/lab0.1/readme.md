# How to compile and use execise1_23.c #

The code can be compiled using regular gcc i.e. : gcc ecercise1_23.c after compiling, the user just needs to use ./a.out to run the program.

The program then receives a filename or file path such as the file that is currently in this directory "test.c" the program will then will return a new file named "noComments.c" in which all comments will have been removed(keep in mind that as of right now the program can remove comments from any file, but the output will always be a file with type ".c").
